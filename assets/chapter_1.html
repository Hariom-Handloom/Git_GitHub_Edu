    <h2>üß† Chapter 1: What is Version Control?</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>üìù Introduction</h3>
    <p>Have you ever saved a file multiple times with names like:</p>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>assignment_final.docx</li>
        <li>assignment_final_revised.docx</li>
        <li>assignment_final_revised2.docx</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is an example of manual version control ‚Äî where you try to manage versions of a file by creating multiple copies with different names. It‚Äôs inefficient, confusing, and prone to mistakes.</p>
    <p>Now imagine working with a team of people all editing the same files ‚Äî it becomes chaotic. That‚Äôs where <b>Version Control Systems (VCS)</b> come in. They <b>automate</b> and <b>organize</b> the way changes to files are tracked.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>üîç What is Version Control?</h3>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.</p>
    <p>It allows you to:
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>Keep track of changes</li>
            <li>Revert back to previous versions</li>
            <li>See who made what changes and when</li>
            <li>Work on the same files with others simultaneously</li>
        </ul>
        Think of version control as a <b>"timeline" of your project</b>. You can move forward, go back, or even split the timeline into alternate directions (branches).
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>üí° Why is Version Control Important?</h3>
    <p>Whether you're a solo developer or working in a large team, version control offers huge benefits:
       <dl>
        <dt>‚úÖ 1. Track Changes:</dt>
        <dd>Every time you make a change, it‚Äôs recorded. You know exactly when and what was changed.</dd>
        <dt>‚úÖ 2. Revert Mistakes:</dt>
        <dd>If something goes wrong, you can easily return to a working version from the past.</dd>
        <dt>‚úÖ 3. Work as a Team:</dt>
        <dd>Multiple people can work on the same project at the same time without overwriting each other‚Äôs work.</dd>
        <dt>‚úÖ 4. Experiment Safely:</dt>
        <dd>You can try new features or fixes in separate branches, and merge them into the main project only when they work.</dd>
        <dt>‚úÖ 5. Keep a History:</dt>
        <dd>A full log is maintained, so you can audit who did what and why, with messages attached to every change.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>üß∞ Types of Version Control Systems</h3>
    <p>
        Version control systems come in different forms:
        <ol>
            <li>Local Version Control</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Only tracks changes on your computer.</li>
                <li>No collaboration or sharing.</li>
                <li>Example: RCS (Revision Control System)</li>
            </ul>
            <li> Centralized Version Control (CVCS)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>There‚Äôs one central server.</li>
                <li>All users connect to that server to get the latest changes or share their own.</li>
                <li>Easy to manage but fails if the server crashes.</li>
                <li>Examples: CVS, SVN (Subversion)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Distributed Version Control (DVCS)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Every user has a full copy of the project, including the entire history.</li>
                <li>No internet needed to make commits or view history.</li>
                <li>More powerful and resilient.</li>
                <li>Example: Git</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">Git is the most popular distributed version control system in the world.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>üåç Real-Life Analogy</h3>
    <p>
        Imagine writing a group report in Google Docs:
        <ul>
            <li>Everyone can write at the same time.</li>
            <li>You can see the revision history.</li>
            <li>You can restore old versions.</li>
            <li>Everyone‚Äôs work is synced in one place.</li>
        </ul>
        Now imagine having the same power for code and files ‚Äî that's what version control offers!
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>üß™ Example Scenario (Without Version Control):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You're building a website and mess something up.</li>
        <li>You didn‚Äôt save a backup.</li>
        <li>You lose hours of work trying to fix it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>üß™ Example Scenario (With Version Control):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You make changes and commit them.</li>
        <li>If something breaks, you run one command and return to a previous version.</li>
        <li>You can compare versions and identify what went wrong.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>üß† Key Terms to Remember</h3>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Term</th>
            <th>Meaning</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Version</td>
            <td>A snapshot of a project at a given time</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Commit</td>
            <td>A saved change</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Repository</td>
            <td>folder/project managed by version control</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Diff</td>
            <td>The difference between two versions</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Revert</td>
            <td>Go back to a previous version</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Branch</td>
            <td>A separate line of development</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
